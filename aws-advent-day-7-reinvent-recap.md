AWS re:Invent Recap
-------------------

Amazon recently held their first AWS specific conference, on Nov. 27th through 29th. Featuring a series of sessions with technical content on cloud use cases, new AWS services, cloud migration best practices, architecting for scale, operating at high availability and making your cloud apps secure.

While I was unable to attend, I've been watching some of the session videos and talking with folks who were able to go.

I wanted to highlight a few of the talks I found informative and interesting.

__Day 1 Keynote__

The day 1 keynote contains a lot of great information on where AWS is headed and what they're planning for the future.

__Failures at Scale and How to Ignore Them__

While this talk didn't necessarily cover anything groundbreaking, it covered a lot of good ideas on failure and scaling.

__Highly Available Architecture at Netflix__

Netflix is definitely leading the way in building a distributed systems on AWS and building tools, many open source, for running systems on AWS. This talk gives a nice overview of how they're doing this.
